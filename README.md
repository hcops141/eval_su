# eval_su
# This is the Github repository you will be working with, please follow the steps below to the best of your ability.
# NOTE: If you are comfortable creating new branches to work off of, please feel free to do so. Otherwise, use the 'main' branch for everything.
# 1. Pull the repository to ensure it is up to date.
# 2. Add a file named ccy_pairs. Using the file /home/user/messages.fix that was generated in the previous exercise, find each unique currency pair from the FIX messages, and put them into this file. Please try to do so programatically using a bash script (there is way to do this with a one-liner).
# 3. Add a file called google_traceroute to the repo. Find the IP address for google using the command line, and run a traceroute. Paste the output of that command into the file.
# 4. Use Git commands to add these files, commit them, and push the changes to the 'main' branch.
